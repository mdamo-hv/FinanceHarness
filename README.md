# FinanceHarness: Autonomous Financial Deep Research Framework

## Overview

**FinanceHarness is an autonomous financial deep research framework.** Ask a
question; FinanceHarness plans, gathers evidence, runs the analysis, and writes a
cited report.

- **Research and compute.** Web search and reading, company and market data, and
  valuation and risk computed from the gathered data, not guessed.
- **Reference-chaining.** One tool's output feeds the next by reference
  (`prev:<call_id>.<path>`), so a price series becomes a correlation with no
  retyping.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The core loop stays in the prompt; everything else
  waits in a catalog and loads on request, so breadth costs nothing until used.
- **Extensible without code.** A `SKILL.md` file composes existing tools into a
  reusable workflow. Drop one in and it is discovered.
- **Grounded.** Every figure traces back to the tool or source it came from.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

FinanceHarness needs [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yijia-Xiao/FinanceHarness.git
cd FinanceHarness
uv tool install .  # installs the `financeharness` command (alias `fh`)
```

From a source checkout, `uv sync` sets up the environment and
`uv run python main.py ...` (or `uv run fh ...`) runs the same CLI without
installing.

### Configure a backbone

Backbones are named by the provider or runtime that serves them. The default is
`gemini` (a cloud backbone that requires only an API key). Configure whichever
suits the machine you are on:

| Backbone | Serves | Infra | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini` | `gemini-3.6-flash` (Google) | cloud | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `gpt` | `gpt-5.6` (OpenAI) | cloud | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | any OpenRouter model (many vendors, one key) | cloud | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `qwen` | Qwen (open-weight) | GPU server | a local vLLM stack |

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...      # makes the Google/Gemini backbone available
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...      # makes the OpenAI/GPT backbone available
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...  # makes the OpenRouter backbone available

# Or point at an OpenAI-compatible vLLM stack you serve yourself:
export FH_QWEN_BASE_URL=http://gpu-box:8000/v1
export FH_QWEN_READER_BASE_URL=http://gpu-box:8001/v1   # the long-document reader
```

Pick a backbone per run with `--profile NAME`, or change the default in
[`configs/providers.json`](configs/providers.json) (or via `FH_PROFILE`).

#### OpenRouter

`openrouter` reaches many vendors' models through one key over the same
OpenAI-compatible wire, so it needs no extra machinery — just a key and the
model slug you want to route to:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
export FH_OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.1          # any `vendor/model` slug
fh -p "Estimate NVDA's intrinsic value with a DCF." --profile openrouter
```

Pin a slug (instead of exporting it per run) and add OpenRouter's routing
preferences in [`configs/providers.json`](configs/providers.json):

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "openrouter": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
      "extra_body": { "provider": { "order": ["anthropic"], "allow_fallbacks": false } }
    }
  }
}
```

Pick a slug that calls tools well — the loop is tool-driven, and a model without
reliable function calling will stall. The backbone reads its own pages, so no
local reader is required.

### Run

One-shot research. The cited report goes to stdout, progress to stderr, so
stdout stays pipeable:

```bash
fh -p "Estimate NVDA's intrinsic value with a DCF."
fh -p "Apple's competitive position in 2026?" --mode research
fh -p "..." --profile gpt --save run.json  # switch backbone; persist trajectory
echo "What's AAPL's P/E?" | fh -p          # question piped via stdin
fh --list                                  # backbones + skills; confirms the install
```

Options: `--mode {auto|research|analytical}`, `--profile NAME`, `--reader NAME`,
`--save PATH`, `--quiet`. Exit code is `0` when the agent produced an answer,
`1` otherwise.

### Modes

Modes are prompt variants over a constant tool registry, so switching never
strands a trajectory. Set with `--mode`.

| Mode | Focus |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Full toolkit; the agent decides |
| `research` | Web-first deep research |
| `analytical` | Numbers-first: data and valuation tools, web for context |

A `-p` one-shot defaults to `research`.

## Tools

Seven tools are always visible; the rest sit in a catalog and are loaded on
demand with `load_tool`.

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Web research** | `search`, `visit`, `compose_citations` |
| **Core** | `calc`, `update_plan`, `load_tool`, `load_skill` |
| **Equity data** | `data_equity_reference`, `data_equity_prices`, `data_equity_fundamentals`, `data_equity_ratios`, `data_equity_comps`, `data_equity_estimates` |
| **Market data** | `data_market_rates`, `data_market_indices` |
| **Valuation** | `compute_valuation_dcf`, `compute_valuation_dcf_sensitivity`, `compute_valuation_wacc` |
| **Risk** | `compute_risk_correlation`, `compute_risk_var`, `compute_risk_beta` |

Company and market data are sourced through `yfinance`.

## Extend with skills

A **skill** is a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + a markdown body) that orchestrates
the existing tools into a reusable workflow, no code required. The model loads
one with `load_skill` when it fits the task. Bundled:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ticker-snapshot` | Quick structured overview of one equity (identity, ratios, price/trend). |
| `dcf-valuation` | Intrinsic value via DCF: fundamentals → CAPM/WACC → project and discount. |
| `relative-valuation` | Peer-median multiples applied to the company for an implied range. |
| `consensus-check` | Sell-side view (targets, estimates, ratings) corroborated against the web. |
| `equity-deep-dive` | The full workflow: qualitative picture + fundamentals + DCF + comps + consensus. |

Discovery runs in increasing precedence: bundled `financeharness/skills/` → a
project `./skills/` → `FH_SKILLS_DIR`. A project skill overrides a built-in by
name, and a malformed one is skipped rather than fatal.

## HTTP + SSE service (optional)

The package also ships an HTTP+SSE service for a remote client or programmatic
use; it is entirely separate from the CLI:

```bash
fh serve  # HTTP+SSE on 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Benchmark

The **FinanceGym** benchmark and leaderboard are maintained at
[google-research/finance_harness](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/finance_harness).
