"""Conversational sessions — pure helpers for multi-turn threading.

A session threads several runs: each turn is seeded with the prior turns'
messages (system stripped — the new run supplies a fresh system prompt), so a
follow-up is grounded in what earlier turns fetched. A turn is committed to the
session only when it cleanly answered — the **no-poison-on-error** guard, so a
failed/aborted turn never corrupts the thread and a retry starts clean.

Storage is the caller's concern (the service uses a file-backed
``SessionStore``);
these helpers are pure + testable.
