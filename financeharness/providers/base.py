"""Provider abstraction — a uniform turn interface over heterogeneous backbones.

Each backbone speaks a different wire protocol (OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions,
Gemini's native SDK). A :class:`Provider` hides that: it
maps the normalized chat history to its native request, issues the call
(streaming
reasoning/content deltas via ``on_delta`` when one is given), and returns a
single
:class:`AssistantTurn`. The loop, recovery, and history threading are written
once
against these normalized types and never touch a provider's native shape.
